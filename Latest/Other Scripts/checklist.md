As a freelance video editor I constantly found myself running into two problems;

1. My adhd brain would forget to do basic things expected of me
1. Keeping track of my hours effeciently and confidently. Using excel is great and all but combersome and clunky at best

`checklist.ahk` was a project I took on to fix those problems. It's a checklist/timer combo script that is designed to be as out of the way as possible while still offering as much functionality as I can squeeze in.

This script can be opened in one of two ways;

- It will automatically generate itself (via `autosave.ahk`) once you start a new project *OR* it'll automatically open an already generated instance once you reopen the same project.
- You can open the script while a project isn't open, select the desired directory and it will either generate a new instance or load a previous instance for that project directory.

**a `project` in this definition is a `Premiere Pro` or `After Effects` project. Those programs contain the project path in their title and can easily be extracted with ahk*
