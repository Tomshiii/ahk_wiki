The idea to do this was thought up by [TaranVH](https://github.com/TaranVH/2nd-keyboard) a previous editor for LTT. You can watch his [video here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZEoss4XIgc)

During editing in Premiere Pro, you are often annoyed by an extremely obnoxious dialogue box asking `"This action will delete existing keyframes. Do you want to continue?"`. We live in a world of Ctrl + z adobe, you don't have to ask me if deleting keyframes is taking things too far.

This script waits for the warning dialogue box that presents you with that question and then instantly inputs and `Enter` keystroke to dismiss it.
